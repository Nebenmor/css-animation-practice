There are 2 ways of creating animations in CSS: Transitions.. And animations.

Transitions wait until a change in a property occurs and then allows those changes to take place over time. 
Without a transition, any changes in a property would take effect immediately. 
Transitions should be used when properties are changed interactively so for example, in CSS, a property can change when hovered on and when focused on.

Animations however, provide keyframes for more control over the animation and allows us to create complex animations on a frame by frame basis. 
Use animations when you want to create complex animations that just work without having to wait for properties that change interactively.
